How It Works
  ReactJS: The project is built using ReactJS. Components like SearchBar, WeatherDisplay, and ErrorHandling manage different parts of the application.
  OpenWeatherMap API: The OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch real-time weather data.
  Geolocation API: The browser's Geolocation API is used to access the user's current location and fetch the local weather data.
  State Management: React's hooks like useState and useEffect manage the state of the application, such as storing user input and weather data.


Technologies Used
  ReactJS: For building the user interface.
  OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching real-time weather data.
  Geolocation API: To get the user’s current location.
  CSS: For styling and making the application responsive.


Future Enhancements
  Add a 7-day weather forecast feature.
